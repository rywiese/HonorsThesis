Theorem prover (continue/re-work my project from 4511W)

Something related to blockchain

Some sort of web app that can be used as a more visual and interactive teaching
tool for csci or math related topics (inspired by a previous thesis project that
was an applet that allowed for the visualization of fibonacci heaps)

Something ML related. I would want to make something creative and entertaining -
some ideas I have found online include:
a neural net that generates a Kanye West style rap song based on the input of
Kanye's entire discography
a neural net that generates cooking recipes
