Administrative Details:
    I need to turn in a proposal form by the end of spring semester
    I do not need to take the thesis for credit, but it may be beneficial in terms
    of a GPA boost, and I may need the GPA boost in order to hit the summa cum
    laude mark. Also, GPA cutoff is based on last 60 credits, so I may be pushing
    some bad grades out. CSCI dept is usually pretty lax about these requirements, so taking
    it for credit most likely won't be an inconvenience, but I should double
    check with the csci/honors rep to make sure.

Ideas:
    Theorem prover (continue/re-work my project from 4511W)

    Something related to blockchain (email about something that requires less power)

    Some sort of web app that can be used as a more visual and interactive teaching
    tool for csci or math related topics (inspired by a previous thesis project that
    was an applet that allowed for the visualization of fibonacci heaps)

    Something ML related. I would want to make something creative and entertaining
    some ideas I have found online include:
        a neural net that generates a Kanye West style rap song based on the input of
        Kanye's entire discography

        a neural net that generates cooking recipes

    encryption (and the math behind it)

    NLP (possibly a method that involves pattern matching with the actual structure
    of language, rather than just statistical analysis of what words go near each
    other often)

    something related to number theory

    language parsing/front end compiler type things

    start a new cryptocurrency (one that doesn't use energy)
        strictly typed, compiled and runs fast
        D, nim, rust (ultra secure), lisp/scheme (guile (works with C), racket (best real version of scheme, realm of racket)), ML, Erlang (concurrency)
