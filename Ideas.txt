Administrative Details:
    I need to turn in a proposal form by the end of spring semester
    I do not need to take the thesis for credit, but it may be beneficial in terms
    of a GPA boost, and I may need the GPA boost in order to hit the summa cum
    laude mark CSCI dept is usually pretty lax about these requirements, so taking
    it for credit most likely won't be an inconvenience, but I should double
    check with the csci/honors rep to make sure.

Ideas:
    Theorem prover (continue/re-work my project from 4511W)

    Something related to blockchain

    Some sort of web app that can be used as a more visual and interactive teaching
    tool for csci or math related topics (inspired by a previous thesis project that
    was an applet that allowed for the visualization of fibonacci heaps)

    Something ML related. I would want to make something creative and entertaining
    some ideas I have found online include:
        a neural net that generates a Kanye West style rap song based on the input of
        Kanye's entire discography

        a neural net that generates cooking recipes
